  # Explaination from the user manual:
  #  Because the PDU/RPP/RPM consists of several panels of circuit
  #  breakers, set the Unit ID in the Modbus program to specify a specific
  #  PDU/RPP/RPM, a specific panel, or a specific breaker (see Table 2).
  #  The PDU/RPP/RPM has a Unit ID of 0, 1, or 255. The same information
  #  can be obtained from any of these IDs. See “PDU/RPP/RPM Registers
  #  and Alarms” on page 65 for more information.
  #
  #  The panel Unit IDs range from 2 to 17. These summary data panel
  #  registers contain the total information for all the breakers in a specific
  #  panel. For example, the registers show the sum total current for each
  #  phase distributed by all the breakers. See “Panel Registers and Alarms”
  #  on page 68 for more information.
  #
  #  The breaker Unit IDs range from 18 to 33. These registers provide
  #  individual breaker data for the specified panel. See “Breaker Data and
  #  Alarms” on page 71 for more information on identifying specific breaker
  #  registers.

  # ADVANCED: Do not include these data points (modbus register addresses);
  #  Review an output modbus table from device to find the addresses.
